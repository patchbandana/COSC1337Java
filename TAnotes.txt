TA Notes:

How to on assignment 4:
0. Sort everything into its proper project/folder
1. create data directory in eclipse-workspace
2. plan out map
3. create characters (5+ no commas)
4. create map (20+ no commas)
5. create items (only after characters.csv are updated 5-10)
6. Implement Get Item functionality:
	In the actionHandler method, improve the 'd' case to handle non-existent items
	Make sure the dropItem method works correctly
	
	For the 'g' (get) command:

		Added a check to see if the item exists in the current map block
		Added an error message when the item doesn't exist: "There is no [item name] here to get."
		Only attempts to get the item if it exists


For the 'd' (drop) command:

		Added a check to see if the item exists in the player's inventory
		Added an error message when the item doesn't exist: "You don't have a [item name] in your inventory."
		Stored the item in a variable before removing it from inventory to use in the confirmation message
		Updated the confirmation message to: "You have dropped the [item name]"



	These changes ensure that when a player tries to get or drop an item that doesn't exist, they'll receive an appropriate error message rather than encountering an error or unexpected behavior.
